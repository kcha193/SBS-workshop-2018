# What is **R**?

> **R** is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics

- Created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman of the Department of Statistics, University of Auckland.
- First version was made available in 1995.
- Has become one of the most popular environments for statistical computing and data science.
- We have three members of the ***R** Development Core Team* in the Department of Statistics.

\center ![](..//..//S-DS-VC-RGB.png){#id .class width=5cm}

 
# Why is **R** so popular?
- It is open-source (FREE)!
- It is powerful:
    
    + Can handle large and complex data sets.
    + Easily program complex simulations.
    + Can be used on High-Performance Computing Cluster.
    + Graphics (much more flexible than SAS, SPSS, JMP, etc.)
    
- Well-support (Stack Overflow, R-Bloggers) from communities of different fields, i.e. **R** packages. https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/. 
- It is flexible (your problem can likely be handled in **R**).
- It runs well on many operating systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux).

\centering You don't need to be a programmer to use **R**!

# **R** and the biological sciences

- Many applications of statistical methods to biological datasets are implemented in **R**.
- These **R** *packages* are publically available on the web for immediate download and use:
      
      - `Bioconductor`, https://www.bioconductor.org/
      - E.g. Next Generation Sequencing, Genomics.

# How to download and install **R** (and **R**Studio)

1. Go to https://cran.stat.auckland.ac.nz.
2. Download the version relevant to your OS (Linux / Mac [(link)](https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-r-and-rstudio-on-mac-e911606ce4f4) / Windows).
3. Install it on your computer.

We *strongly* recommend using the **R** editor called **R**Studio.

- Download and install it from https://www.rstudio.com/download.
- UOA: Both softwares can be installed in the *Software Center*. 
- Great for beginners and advanced use**R**s!

## Reasons to use RStudio
- Writing better code faster with **R**. 
- Producing reports (**R** markdown). 
- Producing interactive reports/tools (Shiny).
- Developing **R** packages.

# **R**studio

-  Now open **R**studio 

\center ![](Figure\rstudio.png){#id .class width=8cm} 

- Then open an **R** script by clicking File $\rightarrow$ New $\rightarrow$ **R** script to show the **Source** pane.

# **R**studio Project

- Divide your work into multiple contexts. 
- Each with their own 

      + **working directory** (grey letters at the top of the Console), 
      + **workspace** (never save this), 
      + **history**, and 
      + **source documents** (**R** code).
      
- Cross-platform on different OS (Linux / Mac / Windows)

## Now create an **R**studio project for this workshop
1. Go to File $\rightarrow$ "New Project", 
2. Choose "Existing directory", 
3. Click browse button to click **into** the folder "Rwrkshop SBS 2018", and 
4. Press "open".

# Using **R** as a calculator

Again open an **R** script by clicking File $\rightarrow$ New $\rightarrow$ **R** script and type and **run (Ctrl + Enter)** the following in the **Source** pane. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
1 + 2

1 + 3^2

log(15) - sqrt(3.4)

pnorm(1.96)

# This is a comment and is not evaluated
```

# Variable assignment

- `<-` is the "assign to" operator, made up of `<` and `-` without a space.
- E.g., `x <- 2` is read as "The value 2 is assigned to the object `x`".

```{r, echo = TRUE, tidy = TRUE}  
x <- 2
y <- 3
x^2 - 3*y + 5
```

-  You can also use `=` instead `<-`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, tidy = TRUE}  
x = 2
y = 3
x^2 - 3*y + 5
```

Note that **R** is **case-sensitive**

```{r, error = TRUE}
X
```


# Getting help
- Google!

    + "How to calculate the average in **R**?"
    + The search results tell you that the `mean()` function is useful.
- Quick-**R**: https://www.statmethods.net/
- **R**-Bloggers: https://www.r-bloggers.com/
- Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r
- Books:
    
    + The **R** Book, by Michael J. Crawley. 
    + **R** for Data Science, by Hadley Wickham, Garrett Grolemund. http://r4ds.had.co.nz/ 


# Getting help -- in **R** 
- `?`
    
    For example, `?mean` brings up the help file for the `mean()` function. It will tell you almost everything you need to know to use `mean()`.

- `??`
    
    For example, `??mean` searches for everything related to "mean" in all the **R** packages installed on your computer.

- `RSiteSearch("mean")`

    Searches everything on CRAN (an online repository of **R** packages). This requires interenet connection.

# Basic principles for data organisation in spreadsheets

> Whatever you do, do it consistently.

Use consistent:

- codes for categorical variables (not M, Male, and male).
- codes for missing values (can use NA or leave blank).

    + Do not use a numeric value (999).

- variable names in all files (glucose_10wk, Gluc10wk)
- subject identifiers (mouse153, M153, 153)
- date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, YY/DD/MM)

Also, be careful about spaces within cells. A blank cell is different to a cell with a space in, and "Male" is different to "&#160;Male".

# Basic principles for data organisation in spreadsheets

> It is worth putting some time and thought into picking good names for things

In general: 

- Do not use spaces in variable (column) names or file names.

    + Use underscores or hyphens instead (but not both).

- Avoid special characters ($, @, %, #, &, (, ), !, /, etc.).
- Never use "final" in the file name.
- Use **short** but *meaningful* names.

# Basic principles for data organisation in spreadsheets  

- Put just one thing in a cell (i.e. separate lat, lon columns).
- Make it a rectangle:

    + Rows corresponding to subjects (or observations).
    + Columns corresponding to variables.
    + Do not scatter tables around a worksheet.
    
- Create a data dictionary.
- No calculations in the raw data files.
- Do not use font colour or highlighting as data.
- Save the data in plain text files (i.e. a CSV).
- Make backups (or use a version control system).

# Basic principles for data organisation in spreadsheets

> Do not overwrite original data files!

\center ![](Figure\dont_overwrite_original.png){} 

# Getting data into **R**

- Always set a working directory using `setwd()`, this can be a directory where you store the data and/or outputting the results.   

      + Ignore this if you are using the **R**studio project.
      + Grey text under the "Console" tab.
   
- Use `read.csv()` to read a CSV file into **R**.
- `dim()`: Returns the number of observations (rows) and variables (columns).
- `head()`/`tail()`: Returns the first/last 6 rows of a data set.
- `str()`: Returns the structure of the dataset, e.g., dimension, column names, type of data object, first few values of each variable.
- `names()`: Returns the names of the variables contained in a dataset.


# CSV file containing patient information 

The patient CSV file has 7 variables:

- `Patient.ID`: Identification Number.
- `Age`: in years
- `Sex`: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
- `Race`: 1 = Caucasian, 2 = African, 3 = Other
- `Weight`: in pounds
- `Height`: in inches
- `Smoke`: 1 = Yes, 2 = No

# Getting data into **R**
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# setwd("your working directory")
patient.df <- read.csv("Data/Patient.csv")
head(patient.df)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
patient.df <- read.csv("..\\..\\data\\Patient.csv")
head(patient.df)
```

> You can use  1 forwardslash (`/`) or 2 backslashes (`\\`). 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# setwd("your working directory")
patient.df <- read.csv("Data\\Patient.csv")
```

> Tip: use "Tab" key to choose to files in `read.csv()` function, within the quotation (`""`).


# Check the variable names

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
#Names of the variables
names(patient.df)
```

- Anything following the `#` symbol is treated as a comment and ignored by **R**.
- Writing comments/documentation is a very good habit to develop, emphasis on *why*. 


# \texttt{dim()} and \texttt{str()}
```{r}
dim(patient.df)
str(patient.df)
```

Note that **character** vector, `Sex`, is automatically converted to **factor**.

# Reading data into **R**
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE, tidy = FALSE}
patient.df <- read.csv("Data/Patient.csv", 
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(patient.df)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
patient.df <- read.csv("..\\..\\Data\\Patient.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(patient.df)
```

## `stringsAsFactors`
`stringsAsFactors` argument is set to `FALSE`, so **character** vectors are not converted to **factor** vectors. We will explain factor in Session 3. 


# Different types of data objects in **R**

**R** has 6 different types of object:

- `character` (alphanumeric; `"hello world"`), e.g. `Sex`
- `numeric` (real or decimal; `3.14159`), e.g. `Weight`, `Height` and `Smoke`.
- `integer` (whole numbers; `256`), e.g. `Patient.ID`, `Age`, `Race`.
- `logical` (`TRUE` (`T`) or `FALSE` (`F`)), e.g.
```{r}
1 == 1
2 <= 0
3 != 2
```
- `factor` (numeric or alphanumeric, treated as categorical)
- `complex` (numbers with imaginary components; `3i`)

# Vectors

- Use `c()` to combine multiple elements separated by comma's.
- A *vector* is a combination of multiple elements of the same object type in 1 dimension (a one-dimensional array).

```{r}
# A character vector contains strings
c("hello", "world")

# A numeric vector contains numbers
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

# We can easily produce sequences using ':'
1:6
```

# Matrices

- Use `matrix()` to create a matrix in **R**.
- A *matrix* is a combination of multiple elements of the same data type in 2 dimensions (a 2-dimensional array).

```{r}
# Create a matrix with 2 rows
matrix(1:6, nrow = 2)

# Create a matrix with 2 columns
matrix(1:6, ncol = 2)
```

# Data frames

- Use `data.frame` to create a data frame in **R**.
- A *data frame* is a collection of multiple vectors (as different columns) that can be different types.

```{r}
my_characters = c("one", "two", "three")
my_numbers = 1:3
my_logicals = c(TRUE, FALSE, F)

data.frame(my_characters, my_numbers, my_logicals)
```

# General Tips (Hotkeys)

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
tibble(
   Hotkeys = c("Ctrl+Enter",
             "Ctrl+Shift+A",
             "Ctrl+Shift+C",
             "Tab",
             "Ctrl+l",
             "Esc",
             "Ctrl+Shift+F10",
             "Ctrl+Up",
             "Alt+Shift+K"),
   Description = c("Run Selected Line(s) of code in the Source pane",
              "Tidy Selected Line(s) of code in the Source pane",
              "Comment Selected Line(s) of code in the Source pane",
              "Complete code in Source or Console pane",
              "Clean the screen the to Console pane",
              "Kill the current operation",
              "Restart **R** (Unload all the loaded **R** packages)",
              "Popup History",
              "Show all Hot keys")) %>%
