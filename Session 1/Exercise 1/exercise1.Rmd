# 1. Using **R** as a calculator

1. Find the values of:

    (a) $1+4$

    ```{r}
      1+4
    ```
    
    (b) $2^3 + \frac{4}{\sqrt{34}}$
    
    ```{r}
      2^3 + 4/sqrt(34)
    ```
    
    (c) $\log{30}$
    
    ```{r}
      log(30)
    ```
    
    (d) $\log_{10}30$
    
    ```{r}
      log(30)
    ```
    
    (e) $|-2|$ \hspace{0.2cm}(Hint: $|x|$ denotes the \emph{absolute
    value} of $x$. Search on Google if you're unsure.)
    
    ```{r}
      abs(-2)
    ```

2. Now open Rstudio, open an **R** script by clicking `File` $\rightarrow$ `New` $\rightarrow$ `R script`.
  
3. Save this script by clicking `File` $\rightarrow$ `Save As...`.
  
4. Select a directory/location and save the script.
  
5. Copy and paste (or just write out again) the code you used for question 1a -- 1e into the script. 

6. You can now submit your script line-by-line using Ctrl $+$ Enter. You can also highlight the code you want to evaluate and press Ctrl $+$ Enter. This will send the highlighted code in the script directly into the console.

7. From now on, type all of your code in your **R** script and submit it to the **R** Console using Ctrl $+$ Enter.

# 2. Reading data into **R**

1. `Lake.csv` contains data on 53 different lakes in Florida. The variable names and what has been measured are presented below.

    + `ID`: ID number of the lake
    + `Lake`: Name of the lake
    + `pH`: pH value
    + `Calcium`: concentration of Calcium 
    + `Chlorophyll`: concentration of Chlorophyll (mg/L)

2. Read the data into **R**, saving it in object named \texttt{lake.df}.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lake.df <- read.csv("Data/Lake.csv", 
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
lake.df <- read.csv("..\\..\\data\\Lake.csv", 
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

3. Use `dim()`, `head()` and `str()` to look at some of the properties of the dataset you have just read into **R**. **Always** perform this important step to check that your dataset is as it should be.

```{r}
dim(lake.df)
head(lake.df)
str(lake.df)
```

Note that RStudio makes this step really easy. Check out the Environment tab in RStudio (see Figure 1).
