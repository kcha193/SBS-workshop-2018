# What if the response variable is **not** continuous?
So far, we have considered methods for analysing response variables measured on a continuous scale.

Often, measurements are:

- **Counts** per unit time, e.g. number of hours worked in a working week.
- **Binary** responses, e.g. Gender.
- **Generalised** linear models: **Poisson** (counts) and **Logistic** (binary) regression
- **Today** logistic regression **only**



# Logistic regression in **R**

- Relates a **binary response variable** to a continuous and/or categorical variable.

- Let's illustrate by example using `combine.df`.
    + Does smoking habit depend on cholesterol level, height or weight?
    + Does the probability of smoking increase with age?
    + What characteristics do smoking patients have, i.e. how do smoking patients different from non smoking patients?

Speaking in statistical language, we have a binary response. A patient is either smoking or non-smoking, there is only two possible outcomes.

Logistic regression is typically used in case control studies. In this case, we can treat smoking as case and non-smoking as control.

# Logistic regression in **R**

\centering

**Question**

Is `Age` a useful indicator of people choosing to `smoke`?  

**How do we answer this?**

By relating the **probability** of `smoking` to `Age`.

- Linear regression is **not** suitable here because:

    + It assumes the response variable takes values from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.
    + But here takes only two values, namely `smoking` or `non-smoking`!


# Relating a probability to an explanatory variable

Let:

- $p = \Pr\left(\mathtt{smoking} \right)$
- $1-p = \Pr\left(\mathtt{non-smoking} \right)$

\vspace{0.2cm}

**Definition:** The **odds** that a respondent `smokes` is
$$ \text{odds} = \frac{p}{1-p}. $$

- The **odds** of an event (i.e. `smoking`) tells us how likely that event is to occur relative to it not occurring.
- To relate $p$ to an explanatory variable, we need the **log-odds**, i.e.

$$ \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \mathtt{Intercept} + \mathtt{Slope} \times \mathtt{Age}. $$

- $\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$ is known as the **logit** transformation.


# GLMs in **R**: `glm()`

`glm(formula, family, data, ...)`

- `formula:` Similar format as `lm()`; response variable and explanatory variable(s) separated by "\~".
- `family:` Use `family = binomial` for logistic regression.
- `data`: name of the data frame containing the variables.
- `...` See the help file of `glm()` (`?glm`) for other arguments.



# Logistic regression in **R**: Example
Suppose we want to find out whether older people are more likely to *smoke*.

Statistically speaking, we want to test whether the probability of `smoking` increases/decreases/does not change with `Age`.



#  Logistic regression in **R**: Example

- Declare the response variable `Smoke.group` as a integer/numeric.

    + `Yes` is assigned the numeric value 1 and
    + `No` is assigned numeric value 0.
  
- It follows, therefore, that:

    1. $p=\Pr(\mathtt{smoke})$
    2. $p/(1-p)$ is the odds of participants "smoke" relative to "non-smoke".

Note: Here, the explanatory variable Age is integer/numeric.



# Logistic regression in **R**: Example
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
# class of Smoke.group?
class(combined.df$Smoke.group)

# Convert Smoke.group to a variable of type 'numeric'
# Assigned to a new variable Smoke.group1 
combined.df$Smoke.group1 <- 
  ifelse(combined.df$Smoke.group == "Yes", 1, 0)

# Numeric values of Smoke.group1?
class(combined.df$Smoke.group1)
```


# Logistic regression in **R**: Example
Fit the model with `glm()`
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
try.glm <- with(combined.df, 
        glm(Smoke.group1~Age,family = binomial))
```

- `family = binomial`, logistic regression.

\vspace{-2mm}
```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary(try.glm)
```

# Logistic regression in **R**: Example
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(try.glm)
```


# Logistic regression in **R**: Example
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(try.glm)$coef
```

\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{logit}(\text{smoke}) & = & `r round(coef(try.glm)[1], 2)` `r round(coef(try.glm)[2], 2)` \times \text{Age}.\\
\text{Odds}(\text{smoke}) & = & e^{`r round(coef(try.glm)[1], 2)` `r round(coef(try.glm)[2], 2)` \times \text{Age}}\\
\text{Probability}(\text{smoke}) & = & \frac{e^{`r round(coef(try.glm)[1], 2)` `r round(coef(try.glm)[2], 2)` \times \text{Age}}}{1 + e^{ `r round(coef(try.glm)[1], 2)` `r round(coef(try.glm)[2], 2)` \times \text{Age}}}
\end{eqnarray*}


# Prediction from the model
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
# Logit scale, usually referred to as the
# 'linear predictor' scale
lp <- predict(try.glm, data.frame(Age = 70))
lp

# Calculate the odds
exp(lp)
```
Interpretation: A 70-year old is \textbf{`r round(exp(lp),1)` times} likely to consider *smoke* than *not smoke*. Or, a 70-year old is \textbf{`r round(1/exp(lp),1)` times more} likely to *not smoke* than *smoke*.


# Prediction from the model
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
#Probability scale
predict(try.glm, data.frame(Age = 70), type = "response")
```

Interpretation: The probability that a 70-year old *smokes* is `r round(predict(try.glm, data.frame(Age = 70), type = "response"), 4)` or `r round(predict(try.glm, data.frame(Age = 70), type = "response"), 4)* 100`%.


# Putting prediction into context
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
#Probability with standard error
predict(try.glm, data.frame(Age = 70),
      type = "response", se.fit = TRUE)
```


# Categorical explanatory variables
```{r, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
try.glm2 <- glm(Smoke.group1 ~ Age.group, family = binomial, data = combined.df)
anova(try.glm2, test = "Chisq")
```

Analysis of deviance table for a `glm()` object (generated using `anova()`) is analogous to ANOVA table for an `lm()` object.

```{r, echo = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
try.glm2 <- glm(Smoke.group1 ~ Age.group, family = binomial, data = combined.df)
```


# Categorical explanatory variables

```{r}
anova(try.glm2, test = "Chisq")
```

We have extremely strong evidence that at least one age group has different log-odds of choosing to "smoke" from the other age groups.


# Categorical explanatory variables
```{r}
summary(try.glm2)
```

# Categorical explanatory variables

```{r}
round(summary(try.glm2)$coef, 4)
```

- `(Intercept)` corresponds to the reference age group, namely "Under 35" which is the one that is *not* listed!
- So, all subsequent rows of this table are hypothesis tests of the log-odds of the named age group relative to the reference group being  zero. 


# Categorical explanatory variables
```{r}
round(summary(try.glm2)$coef, 4)
```

+ There is a strong evidence ($p$-value $=$ 0.0040) that the log-odds of choosing to *smoke* for the "Over 61" age group is **lower** than "Under 35".
+ There is **no** evidence ($p$-value $<$ 0.8839) that the log-odds of choosing to *smoke* for "36 to 60" is **lower** from "Under 35".
    
# Compare "Over 61" with "36 to 60"

- Create another factor for age group with different reference level.
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
Age.refac <- factor(as.character(combined.df$Age.group),
   levels = c("Over 61", "36 to 60", "Under 35"))
```

- Re-fit the model.
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
try.glm3 <- glm(Smoke.group1 ~ Age.refac,
                family = binomial,
                data = combined.df)
```


# Compare "Over 61" with "36 to 60"
```{r, tidy = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
summary(try.glm3)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
round(summary(try.glm3)$coef, 4)
```

There is a strong evidence that the log-odds of choosing to *smoke* for the "36 to 60" age group is **higher** than the ``Over 61'' age group.

# Code 

Insert a chunk of **R** code with 

\includegraphics[width = 0.25\textwidth]{comment.png}

When you compile, **R** markdown will run the code and include its results. 


# inline code

Place code in a sentence with `` `r '\x60r #code\x60'` ``. **R** markdown will replace the code with its results. 

## Input:
Today is `` `r '\x60r Sys.Date()\x60'` ``

## Output
Today is `r Sys.Date()`


# Chuck options 

By default, **R** markdown includes both the code and its results

## Input:
\includegraphics[width = 0.2\textwidth]{first.png}

## Output
```{r}
dim(iris)
```


# `echo`

Add `echo = FALSE` to hide the code. 

## Input:
\includegraphics[width = 0.25\textwidth]{echo.png}

## Output
```{r, echo = FALSE}
dim(iris)
```


# `eval`

Add `eval = FALSE` to prevent the code to run.

## Input:
\includegraphics[width = 0.25\textwidth]{eval.png}

## Output
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dim(iris)
```


# `fig.height`, `fig.width`

To specify the dimension of plots (in inches) with `fig.height` and `fig.width`. 


## Input:

\includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{fig.png}


# `fig.height`, `fig.width`

## Output:
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 5}
hist(iris$Sepal.Width)
```


# `kable()`

`kable()` in `knitr` **R** package allows you to present tables.  

Note the option `results='asis'`, which will pass through results without reformatting them. 

## Input:

\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{kable.png}


# `kable()`

`kable()` in `knitr` **R** package allows you to present tables.   

Note the option `results='asis'`, which will pass through results without reformatting them. 

## Output:
```{r, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(iris))
```


# `knitr` **R** package 

Three important points: 

- The *working directory* is the where the document is placed. (Maybe different to **R** project.)  
- For each document, Knitr compile the **R** code as a new **R** session. Thus, you need to load the required libraries for *that document*.   
-  Any object made in one code chunk will be available to code in the later code chunk. 
- Ctrl + Shift + K: to compile the document.
